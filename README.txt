phpBB3 QuickInstall Bundle

This bundle combines QuickInstall and its dependencies into a single
convenient package.

QuickInstall itself is tracked closely to master. QuickInstall tags will be
added as new QuickInstall releases are made.

Other sources are at their most recent stable versions. Currently these are:

phpBB 3.0.8
automod 1.0.0
umil 1.0.4

There are two separate branches:

The core branch is intended for development of phpBB itself. It has phpBB
sources in sources/phpBB3 but not automod nor umil.

The mod branch is intended for development of phpBB modifications. It
has phpBB, automod and umil sources.
